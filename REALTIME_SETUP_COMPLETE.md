ðŸ”® Realtime Prediction System - Setup Complete
=============================================

âœ… COMPLETED TASKS:
1. âœ… Successfully installed all required dependencies in sql_ai_agent environment:
   - watchdog (6.0.0) - File system monitoring
   - tensorflow (2.18.1) - Deep learning framework  
   - streamlit (1.46.1) - Dashboard framework
   - plotly (6.2.0) - Interactive visualizations

2. âœ… Updated manage.sh script with realtime prediction commands:
   - realtime-watch - Start file monitoring for automatic predictions
   - realtime-dashboard - Launch with Streamlit dashboard
   - realtime-predict - Process single file
   - realtime-cleanup - Clean temporary files

3. âœ… Verified realtime prediction agent functionality:
   - File system monitoring with watchdog
   - Automatic data pipeline processing
   - Champion model loading system
   - Prediction generation and storage
   - Streamlit dashboard creation
   - Temporary file cleanup

ðŸ“‹ AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
```bash
# Start realtime monitoring (watches data/staging directory)
./manage.sh realtime-watch

# Start with interactive dashboard
./manage.sh realtime-dashboard

# Process single file
./manage.sh realtime-predict your_data.csv

# Clean temporary files
./manage.sh realtime-cleanup
```

ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT WORKS:
1. Drop Excel/CSV files into data/staging directory
2. Agent automatically processes through full ML pipeline:
   - Preprocessing (data cleaning, datetime parsing)
   - Aggregation (grouping, wide format conversion) 
   - Feature Engineering (time features, lags, rolling stats)
   - Scaling (using pre-fitted scaler)
   - Encoding (autoencoder embeddings for dense models)
   - Prediction (using champion model)
3. Predictions saved to data/realtime_predictions/
4. Dashboard shows live prediction timeline and statistics

ðŸ“Š DASHBOARD FEATURES:
- Real-time prediction timeline charts
- Summary statistics (latest, average, max predictions)
- Recent predictions table
- Prediction file history
- Auto-refresh capability

ðŸ”§ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS MET:
- âœ… File monitoring with watchdog
- âœ… ML pipeline integration (all agents)
- âœ… Champion model system
- âœ… Both dense and sparse model support
- âœ… TensorFlow autoencoder support
- âœ… Streamlit dashboard
- âœ… Plotly visualizations
- âœ… Automatic cleanup
- âœ… Error handling and logging

ðŸš€ READY FOR PRODUCTION USE!
Drop data files in data/staging and watch the magic happen.
